# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

Project
Out Team was given the project by our client to create a timed quiz to determine if you are a fitness guru, lazy person (couch potato) or addicted to exercise. The quiz is designed that if you miss a question, you are penalized by 10 seconds on your raw score. 
The scores will be stored with users initials so it can be compared with peers.
